# ü§ñ **SMOKI - STL Files Repository**

This repository contains the 3D models and components used in building **SMOKI**, a robot developed by **MAYERDOA ROBOTICS**. These files are essential for replicating or learning from our design process.

## üìÇ **Available STL Files**

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the 3D models included in this repository:

- **[Buck Module Holder](./Buck%20module%20holder.stl)**: Securely holds the buck module in place.
- **[Servo and Steering Shaft Connector](./Servo%20and%20sttering%20shaft%20connector.stl)**: Connects the servo to the steering shaft for precise movements.
- **[Battery Case](./battery%20case%20%281%29.stl)**: Houses and secures the battery module.
- **[Front Sonar Mount](./front_sonar%20mount.stl)**: Mount for the front sonar sensor to enhance obstacle detection.
- **[Pi 4 Mount](./pi%204%20mount.stl)**: Provides a stable base for the Raspberry Pi 4 board.
- **[Servo and Camera Attach](./servo%20and%20camera%20atttach.stl)**: Holds the servo and camera module for vision-based tasks.
- **[Side Sonar Mount](./side%20sonar%20mount.stl)**: Holds sonar sensors for side obstacle detection.
- **[Steering Shaft](./sttering%20shaft.stl)**: Part of the steering mechanism for dynamic control.

## üîß **Bot Structure**

The structure of **SMOKI** is primarily built using **LEGO components** for modularity and easy prototyping. Therefore, this repository contains fewer 3D models, focusing only on the essential custom components.

## üìå **Usage Instructions**

1. **Download the STL Files**: Click on the links above to download individual files or clone the repository to access all files.
2. **3D Printing**: Print the models using your preferred 3D printer and settings. We recommend high-strength PLA or PETG for durability.
3. **Assembly**: Follow the [Robot Assembly Guide](./README.md) for detailed instructions on integrating these components into the robot.

## üèóÔ∏è **Important Note**

These files are part of our legacy bot, **SMOKI**, and reflect our earlier engineering designs. For our latest projects, stay tuned to **MAYERDOA ROBOTICS**!
