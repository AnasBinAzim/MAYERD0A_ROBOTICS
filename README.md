## üöó Mobility Management

The mobility system of our robot has been meticulously designed to ensure smooth, efficient, and reliable movement, addressing both power distribution and maneuverability.

### Front Axle Articulation

The front axle is articulated by a **Servo Motor**, enabling precise steering control. This configuration allows the robot to execute sharp turns and navigate complex paths with accuracy. The servo motor's responsiveness ensures that the robot can adapt to dynamic scenarios effectively, providing the necessary flexibility for competitive tasks.

### Rear Axle Power Distribution

The rear wheels are powered through a **differential gearbox**, driven by a **LEGO Encoder Motor** from the **45560 Expansion Set**. The differential gearbox serves a critical role by enabling the wheels on the same axle to rotate at different speeds while receiving power from a single **DC motor**. This functionality is especially important during turns, where the outer wheel must travel a greater distance than the inner wheel.

#### Understanding the Differential Gearbox

A differential gearbox is a mechanical device that splits the engine torque two ways, allowing each output to spin at a different speed. This is crucial for vehicles, including robots, to navigate turns smoothly. When a vehicle turns, the wheels on the outside of the turn must cover more distance than the wheels on the inside. Without a differential, both wheels would be forced to rotate at the same speed, leading to increased tire wear, reduced traction, and potential mechanical strain.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18ed7431-8bcc-4953-92a2-46f3a52d74c5" width="500" height="305" />
</p>

*Image Source: [LearnMech](https://learnmech.com/working-of-differential-gear-box-for/)*

#### How It Works

The differential gearbox consists of several key components:

- **Input Shaft (Driveshaft):** Transmits power from the motor to the differential.
- **Bevel Gears:** Facilitate the splitting of torque between the wheels.
- **Side Gears:** Connected to the axle shafts, transmitting power to the wheels.
- **Pinion Gears:** Interact with the side gears to allow differential action.

During straight-line movement, the differential distributes equal torque to both wheels, causing them to rotate at the same speed. However, during a turn, the pinion gears rotate around the side gears, allowing one wheel to speed up and the other to slow down, accommodating the difference in distance each wheel travels.

#### Benefits in Robotic Applications

- **Smooth Turning:** Enables the robot to navigate turns without wheel slippage or mechanical strain.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Reduces the power required to maneuver, conserving battery life.
- **Component Longevity:** Minimizes wear on wheels and axles, extending the lifespan of mechanical parts.

#### Integration with LEGO Encoder Motor

The LEGO Encoder Motor provides precise control over rotational speed and direction, which, when combined with the differential gearbox, allows for:

- **Accurate Speed Regulation:** Ensures that the differential receives consistent input, facilitating predictable wheel behavior.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** The encoder provides real-time data on motor performance, enabling adjustments for optimal operation.

### Motor Control System

To control the motors effectively, we integrated an **L298N Motor Driver**. This versatile motor driver module enables bidirectional motor control and speed regulation for both the encoder and DC motors. Key features of the L298N include:

- **Dual H-Bridge Design:** Facilitates independent control of two motors.
- **PWM Support:** Allows precise speed adjustments for optimal performance.
- **Current Overload Protection:** Enhances system reliability by safeguarding agai

| **Command**                      | **Description**                              |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `sudo apt update`                | Updates the system package list.            |
| `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y` | Installs Python 3 and pip.                |

### 4. Installing OpenCV and Geany Editor

#### Install OpenCV
To enable computer vision functionalities, install OpenCV:

| **Command**                      | **Description**                              |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `pip3 install opencv-python`     | Installs OpenCV.                             |
| `pip3 install opencv-python-headless` | Installs a lightweight version of OpenCV. |

#### Install Geany Editor
We used **Geany**, a lightweight IDE, for programming:

| **Command**                      | **Description**                              |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `sudo apt install geany -y`      | Installs Geany editor.                       |

### 5. Remote Access with RealVNC

To remotely access the Raspberry Pi, we used **RealVNC**. Here's the setup process:

#### Step 1: Install RealVNC
Run the following commands:

| **Command**                      | **Description**                              |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `sudo apt update`                | Updates the system package list.            |
| `sudo apt install realvnc-vnc-server realvnc-vnc-viewer -y` | Installs RealVNC.                  |

#### Step 2: Enable VNC
Enable VNC via the Raspberry Pi configuration tool:

| **Command**                      | **Description**                              |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `sudo raspi-config`              | Opens the Raspberry Pi configuration tool.  |

- Navigate to **Interface Options > VNC** and select **Enable**.

#### Step 3: Start the VNC Server
Start the VNC server:

| **Command**                      | **Description**                              |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `vncserver`                      | Starts the VNC server.                       |

#### Step 4: Automate VNC Server on Boot
To ensure the VNC server starts automatically on boot:

1. Open the VNC service configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@.service

[Unit]
Description=Start VNC Server at user logon
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=pi
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vncserver :1
ExecStop=/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

sudo systemctl enable vncserver@1.service
sudo systemctl start vncserver@1.service
```


#### Step 5: Connect Remotely

Find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi by running:

| **Command**      | **Description**                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `hostname -I`    | Displays the IP address of the Raspberry Pi.        |

1. Open **RealVNC Viewer** on your computer.
2. Enter the IP address (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) in the connection bar.
3. Log in using the VNC password you set during configuration.
