## üéØ Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an autonomous robot capable of navigating a track, avoiding obstacles, and parking precisely, as outlined in the WRO Future Engineers 2024 guidelines.

### Mission Details

Our robot will participate in two rounds, each with unique goals related to autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and parking accuracy.

### üèÅ Round 1: Lap Completion

In **Round 1**, the bot must autonomously complete **three laps** around the track without needing to avoid obstacles.

- **Objective**: Complete three laps within the time limit.
- **Tasks**: Path-following and speed control.

 />
</div>

### üèÜ Round 2: Lap Completion with Obstacle Avoidance and Parking

In **Round 2**, the bot must complete **three laps** while avoiding green and red obstacles:
  - **Green Obstacles**: The bot should move **left** to avoid.
  - **Red Obstacles**: The bot should move **right** to avoid.
  
After completing the laps, the bot must accurately park within a designated zone.

- **Objective**: Complete three laps, avoid obstacles, and park in the designated area.
- **Tasks**: Obstacle detection, color-based avoidance, and precision parking.
