### üåü **The Meaning Behind MAYERDOA**

Our team name, **"MAYERDOA,"** translates to **"Mother's Prayers"** in Bengali, a tribute to the unwavering support of our mothers. They have been our guiding light, steadfastly cheering us on from the initial selection to the WRO global stage. Through every challenge, they are our invisible strength‚Äîtheir love and prayers fueling each achievement, each step forward, each line of code. Their blessings are woven into the fabric of this project, making it more than just a technical endeavor; it‚Äôs a heartfelt journey.

## üéØ Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an autonomous robot capable of navigating a track, avoiding obstacles, and parking precisely, as outlined in the WRO Future Engineers 2024 guidelines.

### Mission Details

Our robot will participate in two rounds, each with unique goals related to autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and parking accuracy.

### üèÅ Round 1: Lap Completion

In **Round 1**, the bot must autonomously complete **three laps** around the track without needing to avoid obstacles.

- **Objective**: Complete three laps within the time limit.
- **Tasks**: Path-following and speed control.

## üéØ Project Objective

This project is designed to meet the challenges and missions set forth in the **WRO 2024 Future Engineers** category. Our robot will participate in two rounds, each with specific goals related to autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and parking accuracy.

### Mission Overview for WRO Future Engineers Rounds

### üèÅ Round 1: Lap Completion

In **Round 1**, the robot must autonomously complete **three laps** on a pre-defined track. The goal of this round is for the bot to demonstrate stable navigation and precise lap tracking without any obstacle avoidance requirements.

- **Objective**: Complete three laps on the track within the allotted time.
- **Key Tasks**: Accurate path-following, speed control, and lap counting.

### üèÜ Round 2: Lap Completion with Obstacle Avoidance and Parking

In **Round 2**, the bot must complete **three laps** while avoiding green and red obstacles:
  - **Green Obstacles**: The bot should move **left** to avoid.
  - **Red Obstacles**: The bot should move **right** to avoid.
  
After completing the laps, the bot must accurately park within a designated zone.

- **Objective**: Complete three laps, avoid obstacles, and park in the designated area.
- **Tasks**: Obstacle detection, color-based avoidance, and precision parking.
