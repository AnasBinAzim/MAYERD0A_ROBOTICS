#### üõ†Ô∏è Chassis Assembly Process

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step overview of the chassis assembly process using the LEGO 45560 Expansion Set:

1. **Base Frame Construction**: Start by assembling the base frame using 5x11 and 5x7 beams for structural stability. These beams provide a strong foundation for mounting additional components.
2. **Motor and Axle Integration**: Utilize the LEGO Technic beams and axle connectors to securely attach the motors. Ensure proper alignment to enable smooth and controlled movement.
3. **Reinforcing with Angular Beams**: Use the 4x6 and 3x5 angular beams to reinforce corners and support areas where weight and stress are concentrated.
4. **Mounting Sensors and Electronics**: Attach sensor mounts and electronic components using cross blocks and bushings, making sure they are aligned for efficient data capture and processing.
5. **Gear Assembly for Differential Drive**: Assemble gears (8, 16, and 24-tooth gears) to create a differential drive system, allowing independent rotation of wheels for smooth turns.

---

#### üîç Benefits of Using LEGO Technic Parts

- **Modularity**: The LEGO Technic beams and connectors allow for quick modifications, so adjustments can be made without disrupting the entire structure.
- **Durability**: High-quality materials ensure the chassis remains stable even during rigorous testing.
- **Precision**: Technic gears, axles, and connectors provide precise alignment, which is critical for movement control and sensor accuracy.

# üöó Mobility Management

The mobility system of our robot has been meticulously designed to ensure smooth, efficient, and reliable movement, addressing both power distribution and maneuverability. This section outlines the evolution of our robot's mobility systems, including upgrades to the steering and gear systems.

---

### **Rear Axle Power Distribution**

Initially, the rear wheels were powered through a **Bevel Gear**, but we later upgraded to a **Differential Gearbox** to improve efficiency and performance during turns.

---

#### **Bevel Gear**

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e19661f-b921-4bea-9028-4e0274306ced" width="300"/>
</div>
</td>
<td width="50%">

A **bevel gear** is a type of gear where the axes of the two shafts intersect, and the tooth-bearing faces of the gears are conical. Bevel gears are commonly used to transfer motion between intersecting shafts at an angle, typically 90¬∞.

##### **How Bevel Gears Work**
- A driver gear transfers motion to a driven gear, which rotates an output shaft.
- The teeth of the gears are designed to mesh smoothly, transferring torque efficiently between the shafts.

##### **Advantages of Bevel Gears**
1. **Compact Design**: Suitable for space-constrained applications.
2. **Efficient Torque Transfer**: Provides reliable power transmission at angles.
3. **Versatility**: Can operate at angles other than 90¬∞ if needed.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

#### **Differential Gearbox**

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

A **differential gearbox** allows the wheels on the same axle to rotate at different speeds while receiving power from a single motor. This is crucial for smooth turning, where the outer wheel must travel a larger distance than the inner wheel.

##### **Advantages of Differential Gearbox**
1. **Smooth Turns**: Adapts to varying wheel speeds, ensuring efficient cornering.
2. **Energy Efficiency**: Reduces energy wastage by minimizing wheel slippage.
3. **Component Longevity**: Minimizes wear on tires and axles.

##### **How Differential Gears Work**
- Power from the motor is delivered to an input shaft.
- The differential splits the torque between the two wheels via bevel or spider gears inside the housing.
- During turns, the differential allows one wheel to spin faster than the other, ensuring smooth movement.

### **Servo Motor with L293D Motor Driver**

<table>
<tr>
<td width="30%">
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffcfa0ae-2682-4199-8c0b-4bcbff421d08" width="150"/>
</div>
</td>
<td width="70%">

We used the **L293D Motor Driver** in combination with a **Servo Motor** to control the robot's wheels effectively. The L293D is a dual H-Bridge motor driver that is perfectly suited for the LEGO motor, which operates at **750mA** current.

##### **Why L293D?**
- **Optimal Current Capacity**: Can handle up to **1A** peak current, suitable for the LEGO motor‚Äôs 750mA requirement.
- **Bidirectional Control**: Facilitates forward and backward motion of the wheels.
- **Compact and Lightweight**: Ideal for small-scale robotic systems.
- **PWM Support**: Enables smooth speed control of the motors.

##### **Advantages of the Servo Motor with L293D**
1. **Accurate Steering**: The servo motor ensures precise angle adjustments.
2. **Smooth Speed Control**: PWM functionality provides variable speed control.
3. **Efficient Current Management**: Matches the LEGO motor's current needs, ensuring reliable operation.

#### **Comparison: Bevel Gear vs. Differential Gearbox**

| **Feature**                | **Bevel Gear**                            | **Differential Gearbox**                |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Turning Efficiency**     | Limited; fixed wheel speeds.             | Superior; wheels rotate independently. |
| **Energy Usage**           | Higher due to slippage during turns.     | Lower; optimized for dynamic turns.    |
| **Durability**             | Higher strain on components.             | Reduced strain; longer component life. |

---

### **Steering Systems**

Our robot initially used the **Ackermann Steering System**, known for its efficiency in real-world vehicles. However, we later transitioned to the **LEGO Steering System** to simplify the design and improve modularity while maintaining effective steering control.

#### **What is Ackermann Steering System?**

The **Ackermann Steering System** ensures that the wheels of a vehicle turn at different angles during a corner. The inner wheels turn more sharply than the outer wheels, reducing tire slippage and allowing smooth, efficient turning.

##### **How Ackermann Steering Works**
- The front wheels are connected via a set of steering arms.
- These arms are angled so that their lines meet at the center of the turn‚Äôs radius, ensuring concentric paths for all wheels.

##### **Advantages of Ackermann Steering**
1. **Efficient Turning**: Minimizes tire slippage.
2. **Energy Savings**: Reduces power loss caused by wheel drag.
3. **Realistic Simulation**: Mirrors real-world vehicle steering.

#### **Why We Switched to LEGO Steering System**

The **LEGO Steering System** offered greater simplicity and modularity, which were critical for our robot‚Äôs design. While Ackermann Steering is ideal for large-scale vehicles, the LEGO system provided better adaptability for our compact robot.

#### **What is LEGO Steering System?**

The LEGO Steering System uses modular LEGO Technic parts with a simple rack-and-pinion mechanism for steering. It achieves a turning angle of **50 degrees**, allowing precise control over the robot's movements.

##### **Advantages of LEGO Steering**
1. **Modularity**: Easy to assemble, adjust, and maintain.
2. **Compact Design**: Fits seamlessly into the robot‚Äôs chassis.
3. **Precision**: Allows accurate steering movements with a servo motor.
4. **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the overall system design without sacrificing functionality.

## üì° Sonar Mount Design

### üõ†Ô∏è Previous Design
In our earlier design, we used **HC-SR04 sonar sensors** placed at **45-degree angles**, mounted horizontally on two sides of the robot, with one sensor placed vertically in the middle. This configuration provided basic obstacle detection but had limitations:
- **üö´ Blind Spots**: The horizontal placement created gaps in detection range at certain angles.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent Readings**: The 45-degree angle sometimes caused inaccuracies due to signal reflections.

- Replaced the 45-degree sensors with sensors mounted at **15 degrees**.
- Mounted the sensors **vertically on all sides**, ensuring:
  - **üõë Improved Obstacle Detection**: Enhanced accuracy and coverage around the robot.
  - **üìè Better Range Consistency**: Reduced signal reflection issues for more reliable readings.

### üöÄ Current Design
The new configuration leverages **HC-SR04 sonar sensors**, chosen for their **wide availability** and **affordable price**. The updated design provides:
- **360¬∞ Coverage**: Vertical mounting eliminates blind spots.
- **Early Detection**: Enhanced obstacle sensing allows for quicker decision-making.
