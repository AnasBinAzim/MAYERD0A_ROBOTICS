## üìÖ Mission Overview for WRO Future Engineers Rounds

### üèÅ Round 1: Precision and Navigation

In Round 1, the robot must navigate through a series of checkpoints, avoiding obstacles and accurately aligning with predefined markers. This round tests the bot's ability to follow complex paths, maintain speed control, and react to sudden changes in the track layout.

- **Objective**: Complete a circuit of checkpoints within the allotted time while avoiding specific obstacles.
- **Key Tasks**: Obstacle detection, precise movement, and real-time sensor data processing.

### üèÜ Round 2: Task-Based Challenge

Round 2 builds on the navigation skills from Round 1 by adding task-based challenges, such as identifying and sorting objects, detecting and avoiding new obstacles, and stopping at designated areas. The robot must demonstrate a higher level of decision-making and adaptive behavior in this round.

- **Objective**: Identify specific objects on the track, pick and place as required, and avoid new obstacles.
- **Key Tasks**: Object identification, adaptive pathfinding, and interaction with movable elements.
