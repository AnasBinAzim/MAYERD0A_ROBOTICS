To power the **Raspberry Pi 5** and other components, we used the **LM4016 10A buck converter** to step down battery voltage from **8.4V** to **5V**. This stable 5V supply is crucial for the Raspberry Pi, which demands between **5-6A** at peak performance. The converter efficiently regulates voltage, ensuring minimal energy loss.

### MT3608 Boost Converter for Motor Power ðŸ”¼
